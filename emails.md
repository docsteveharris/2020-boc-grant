## 2020-10-13 updated for this round

Dear Folkert/Harry/Merv

You'll remember helping me out with a Fellowship application for at the beginning of the year. The applications were put on hold and then cancelled because of COVID. They've now been re-advertised but with a request to orient toward COVID-19 related work. The original proposal used peri-operative medicine as its theme but was mainly methodological in that it focused on implementing the nudge learning ideas I've mentioned. 

I thought that I would therefore re-apply with the same methodological idea but focus on the timing of respiratory support in COVID-19. I think this works well. The main ICU trial launched during 'surge 1' compares modes of respiratory support but I think that question has largely been settled. Most people agree that there is a role for CPAP but the struggle now is when to start and when to stop. Timing questions such as this never fit parallel arm RCTs well. The late group in particular tends to have a lot of protocol violations as people remove the 'improvers' from the study.

More detailed notes are below.

The deadline is October 30. 

I'm writing now to ask if you'd be prepared to support again. That means the usual letters of support, and agreeing to host me here at the IHI if I'm successful.

Please let me know if you think this is possible.

Many thanks

Steve

Background in brief:
- British Oxygen Company (BOC) Chair of Anaesthesia Fund ... endowment of a research fellowship in a department of Anaesthesia.   to support ... working towards a senior fellowship or developing a credible application for a Chair in Anaesthesia (or related specialties) in the next five years. Applications are welcomed from clinicians and from basic scientists with a similar ambition. See https://www.niaa.org.uk/article.php?newsid=1474
- **£80k/year for 4 years**; reasonably flexible spend and charitable so I assume this can be leveraged by UCL if I'm successful
- I'd like to bring together 3 themes
	- IHI/you/CRIU and adaptive embedded trial design
	- Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative (with Merv) 
    - ?DECOVID
	- [Ramani Moonesinghe](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anaesthesia/people/professor-ramani-moonesinghe-frca-mrcp-fficm-mdres) who is friend and collaborator; we've previously worked together on a national trial and this would clearly orient the work to the anaesthesia/periop domain

Proposal in brief:
- Leverage CC-HIC and add a 'COVID' extension to include inpatients with COVID regardless of critical care status
- Build a trials pipeline that 
    - starts with good PPI to define areas of interest that are not amenable to standard RCT approaches
        that is
        - optimisation of routine care rather than investigation of novel therapies
        - where there is existing variation in routine practice
        - where the choice is on a continuum rather than binary (drug A vs drug B) 
    - evaluates the question using observational data and physician prescribing preference designs    
    - implement a variant of the REMAP methodology (Randomised Embedded Multi-factorial Adaptive Platform Trials; Angus, DC, ‘Fusing Randomized Trials With Big Data: The Key to Self-learning Health Care Systems’, JAMA vol. 314, no. 8, 2015, pp. 767-768.)

Previously I'd argued that we'd do this for 'small beans/marginal gains' stuff. We've got a current example being developed by a PhD student co-supervised by Folkert and myself looking at thresholds for supplementing Magnesium in the ICU. However, this time round I'd like to be bolder and tackle what I think is the big question that remains for ICU management of COVID-19: when is it appropriate to use CPAP.

with a heavy emphasis on using EHR phenome to investigate and exploit treatment heterogeneity 
	- select routine treatments decisions with significant variabilty and clinical equipoise
	- embedded nudged rather than mandated randomisation
		- where clinician complies with nudge then use instrumental variable analysis to get at the causal effect
		- where the clinicians refuse to comply then define the phenome of the subgroup


## 2020-10-13 original notes from jan

Hi Harry. Excuse the double pronged text and email attack. Am writing a 4-year fellowship grant app at short notice (deadline 31 Jan). Not a lot of £ but good opportunity and only comes round every 4 years. I'd like to base this at IHI and would need your support. Did you have 30mins to discuss? 

Dear Harry

Proposal in brief:
- Leverage CC-HIC and add a 'peri-op' arm
	- **expand to all inpatient surgery**; equivalent to approx 4000 cases per trust per year (1 million cases per year across the NHS); difficult to do this beyond UCLH with this budget but would aim to find additional money to scale
	- **leverage existing snap national audit experience**, data and design (SNAP-2: Moonesinghe, SR, DJN Wong, L Farmer, R Shawyer, PS Myles, **SK Harris**, ‘SNAP-2 EPICCS: the second Sprint National Anaesthesia Project-EPIdemiology of Critical Care after Surgery: protocol for an international observational cohort study.’, BMJ Open vol. 7, no. 9, 2017, pp. e017690.)
	- argue that this creates the framework for a unique scalable international resource for studying surgical outcomes
- Iterate on the REMAP methodology (Randomised Embedded Multi-factorial Adaptive Platform Trials; Angus, DC, ‘Fusing Randomized Trials With Big Data: The Key to Self-learning Health Care Systems’, JAMA vol. 314, no. 8, 2015, pp. 767-768.) but for 'small beans/marginal gains' stuff with a heavy emphasis on using EHR phenome to investigate and exploit treatment heterogeneity 
	- select routine treatments decisions with significant variabilty and clinical equipoise
	- embedded nudged rather than mandated randomisation
		- where clinician complies with nudge then use instrumental variable analysis to get at the causal effect
		- where the clinicians refuse to comply then define the phenome of the subgroup

Worked example: paracetamol for post-operative fever
- paracetamol pros: pain/comfort
- paracetamol cons: masks fever and delays recognition of infection; blunts immune benefits of hyperthermia
- demonstrate that there is variation in practice
- then embed a nudge in the EHR to prescribe/not prescribe post-operatively
- follow-up process measures
	- patient characteristics (e.g. are we more nervous about harm from fever in patients who have neurosurgery)
	- antibiotic prescribing patterns
	- postive microbiology in the early post-operative period
	- patient length of stay 
- follow-up longer term outcome measures including survival


Worked example: oxygen prescriptions post-operatively
- oxygen pros: tissue oxygenation; wound healing
- oxygen cons: lung injury; altered cell differentiation in healing etc
- demonstrate that there is variation in practice
- then embed a nudge in the EHR for high/low SpO2 targets
- follow-up process measures
	- patient characteristics (e.g. are we more nervous about harm from O2 in patients who COPD)
	- respiratory complications (use POMS)
	- patient length of stay 
- follow-up longer term outcome measures including survival

Proposal in 3 lines:
1. Leverage CC-HIC and add a 'peri-op' arm
	- existing data sharing agreements and data management toolkit
	- add in inpatient surgery initially at UCLH but with the governance to scale to other CCHIC sites
2. Pilot REMAP-Nudge. That is embed a randomised trial into the EHR at UCLH that focuses on developing personalised treatment strategies for routine care (marginal gains). Every treatment decision is either 
	- 'nudged' toward best practice where there is clear evidence
	- randomly 'nudged' so that it becomes an 'n of 1' learning event that quickly scales because we embed the nudge in the EHR and use a presumed consent/opt-out model
