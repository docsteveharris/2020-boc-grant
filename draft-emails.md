Dear Folkert
You’ll remember that I applied for a 4-year fellowship back in January (Royal College of Anaesthetists/British Oxygen Company). That application was postponed and then cancelled because of COVID. They have now invited applications to resubmit, but asked for the proposal to be orientated toward COVID-19. The deadline is 2 weeks away.
The original application was to develop ‘nudge-learning’ in peri-operative medicine. I’ve re-written an application based on the ideas that we’ve discussed with Matt on the duration of CPAP support, and on oxygen saturation targets (as a simpler place to start more akin to the Magnesium work). The proposal is over 4 years so I’ve tried to make the cases that we’re building an incubator for these ideas (at UCLH. Some will graduate on to full trials that would need wider multi-centre involvement, but that you can’t take that step if you don’t pilot the work somewhere, and that’s what we set-up to do here.
I’m still wrestling with how to include the higher risk CPAP question (which is of prime clinical interest) with the fact that this is a 4 year programme and the grant can’t support a multi-site study which would be needed to actually get an answer for this. I think the answer is that we’re building an early stage incubator here, and the grant delivers the infrastructure to repeatedly push fresh questions through that pathway.
Would you be happy to remain involved?
I’m also going to write to Harry as I need IHI to offer to be my host as the fellowship is around career development as well as the research question.

Dear Harry

You'll remember that I applied for a 4-year fellowship back in January (Royal College of Anaesthetists/British Oxygen Company). That application was postponed and then cancelled because of COVID. They have now invited applications to resubmit, but asked for the proposal to be orientated toward COVID-19. The deadline is 2 weeks away. 

The original application was to develop 'nudge-learning' in peri-operative medicine.  I've re-written an application using topics relevant to COVID but am still wrestling with how I can offer research relevant to a pandemic now over a 4-year timescale, and on a relatively modest budget (£80k/yr) which precludes doing anything multi-site.

I think the answer is to propose using CCHIC as an incubator to design embedded REMAP style trials. The trials use nudged rather than mandated randomisation so we can move toward opt-out rather than point-of-care consent. This eventually permits broad enrolment with randomisation integrated into the structure of a learning health care system. The pipeline starts with the right PPI, moves on to retrospective physician prescribing preference studies, and then pilots the nudge-randomisation in a simple format with pre-emptive rather than presumed consent. At this stage, the trials graduate from the incubator here at UCLH, and get shared with other digitally enabled sites.

The clinical question that I'd love to tackle is around the duration of CPAP support but I think this is high risk, so have included a less challenging one on oxygen saturation targets.

Would you be happy to for IHI to host this work? The fellowship is around career development (as usual) as well as the specific question, and I need to be able to show that I'm doing this with the right team in the right place.

Rough draft of the lay and scientific summary below.
The two don't quite marry up because I'm still unsure as to whether to focus on smaller 'marginal gains' questions, or whether to keep the CPAP question. Work in progress.

# Lay summary

A patient does not choose when to fall ill, nor can he or she anticipate what illness they might experience when choosing a job or buying a house. Yet timing and location both determine the health care that is provided, and the doctors, nurses and other professionals that you meet. In most cases, there is a random component to the clinician-patient pairing leading to variation in practice.
Health care systems work hard to reduce unwarranted variation by building up guidelines, standardising pathways and educating their work force. Yet some variation remains because for many questions there is no proof that one strategy is superior to another. Where resources permit, such questions are put to test in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  All RCTs depend on such variation or doubt, or more specifically **equipoise**, to balance the clinician's duty to provide the best current treatment for the patient, and the scientist's duty to identify the best future treatment. Equipoise is defined as "honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians" about the best treatment strategy.[@London2018@410] 
With a new disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the uncertainty is inevitably much greater and the disagreements more vociferous. Parallel arm RCTs serve well for simple binary comparisons of one drug versus another, but they are too expensive to be a tool for the many small questions we face, and too crude for crucial but subtle questions of timing and dose or intensity. How much oxygen is enough, or when to escalate to from CPAP to invasive ventilation (IMV) are false dichotomised into 'low' versus 'high', or 'early' versus 'late'. Yet these 'finely judged' decisions are exactly those where equipoise exists, and variation is found.
Rather than seeing this variation as a problem, we propose a simple and safe modification of REMAP (**Randomised Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform**)[@angus2015] trials using **nudge theory** to extract learning instead. We will embed in the EHR a clinical decision support (CDS) framework. Where there is existing good evidence, the CDS will alert the clinician at the point of care and reduce variation. However, where there is equipoise, the alert will randomly nudge the clinician. 'Doctor A' will be nudged to behave for that instant like 'Doctor B', and 'Doctor B' like 'Doctor A'. The bedside clinician remains in charge. The nudge is _not_ a mandate. Where the individual clinician also has equipoise and complies with the nudge, we recruit to our embedded RCT. Where the expert clinician refuses because of their specific knowledge, we characterise the patient and learn. Regardless the patient receives the best care, and the scientist learns. 
This proposal will attempt to implement this methodology using an established multi-centre data collection platform (Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative), and pilot the approach using bedside alerts to clinicians embedded in the Electronic Health Record at UCLH. We have selected two key questions: one 'low risk' where we evaluate the optimum oxygen target, and one 'high risk' where we evaluate the optimum duration of CPAP therapy. Both questions are key to the management of SARS-CoV-2 but also relevant for all respiratory disease in critical care. The former is low risk because its implementation is simple, and we have good RCT evidence to show that variation is permissible. The latter is high risk because it is already polarising the critical care community, but is fundamental to our understanding of how to provide respiratory support.


# Research Summary

## Problem statement
> The best mechanism to generate generalizable estimates of treatment effect (ie, broader answers) and understand heterogeneity of treatment effect (ie, narrower answers) is to have extremely broad enrolment, ideally representative of the entire breadth of a disease or condition.[@angus2015]
> Derek Angus, JAMA, 2015

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for delivering clinical evidence but 'broad enrolment' is near impossible. This is both due to cost, and because their structure imposes a false dichotomy on what are often finely judged clinical decisions. They work well for binary comparisons (e.g. Phase 3 trials), but only offer broad guidance on questions of timing and dose. RCT results are true only on _average_, and if we wish to move toward personalised medicine, to unpick heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE), and to optimise questions of timing and dose, then we need a new structure that does not forgo the benefits of randomisation.

**REMAP** (**Randomised Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform**) trials provide a partial solution to efficiency and cost by embedding the RCT in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and efficiently using the sample by adaptively randomising.[@angus2015] However, point of care recruitment and consent remains expensive, and multi-arm trials cannot approach the subtlety needed for personalised medicine.

## Proposal
I propose a modification of REMAP using **nudge theory** that allows randomisation and recruitment using pre-emptive or presumed consent.[@thaler2009] This practical alternative exploits existing variation in practice to deliver randomisation safely, efficiently and at scale. Variation in practice is used as evidence of clinical equipoise: "honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians" about the best treatment strategy.[@london2018@410] Treatment allocation is nudged not mandated. The nudge is delivered using clincial decision support (CDS) tool within the EHR with one of three effects:

1. Where evidence already exists, the trial alerts the clinician and reduces unwarranted variation.
2. Where evidence is lacking and the clinician _overrules_ the nudge based on their expert knowledge, the trial learns the specific patient characteristics that led to that decision.
3. Where evidence is lacking and the clinician _complies_ with the nudge,  the trial recruits without further cost.

The decision boundaries in (2) and (3) are flexible: different clinicians will find equipoise at different moments. Because equipoise is internally identified, and  not externally and pre-emptively imposed, we recruit broadly and can evaluate non-binary decisions.  The result is an RCT with imperfect compliance: a prospective implementation of a physician prescribing preference study combined with the ideas that underlie Person-centered Treatment (PeT) effects.[@rassen2009c, @Grieve2019] The health care system reduces unwarranted variation, the clinician provides the best current treatment where evidence exists, and the scientist identifies the best future treatment where evidence is lacking.

## A worked example: What is the optimum target oxygen saturation?
The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommend an SpO~2~ target of 94-98% in most circumstances[@odriscoll2017], but there is much routine variation.[@post2019] A recent 1000 patient RCT failed to find a benefit from a conservative (low SpO~2~) strategy.[@icu-rox2019] Yet observational studies suggest heterogenous benefit.[@palmer2019a] REMAP-nudge would implement a CDS that nudges for a conservative (SpO~2~ 94%) or liberal (SpO~2~ 98%) target. Targets outside of the BTS range would be nudged in range. Novel subgroups (beyond stroke, myocardial infarct) where expert opinion overruled the nudge would be defined. And if the nudge was followed in just half the cases, REMAP-Nudge would recruit many-fold faster than the largest trial to date (50% of 2,000 ICU admissions/year versus 1000 cases from 21 sites over >2 years).[@icu-rox2019]

## Safe pathways: A trial incubator for REMAP-Nudge 
Classical parallel arm RCTs remain the right tool for evaluation of investigational therapies. Simple Drug A vs Drug B questions are more efficiently and safely answered in small, tightly controlled studies with mandated treatment arms.
REMAP-Nudge is designed for optimisation of existing care. Embedded randomisation creates broad enrolment balancing the imperfect compliance of the nudge. Moving from point of care to presumed consent requires a safe environment to pilot the question. Specifically, we propose building a pathway with the following stages 

1. Patients and health care providers partner to identify areas of variation in practice
2. A retrospective physician prescribing preference study produces an early estimate of treatment effects
3. A simplified prospective pilot trial with pre-emptive consent evaluates the efficacy of the nudge and the acceptability of opt-out consent.

Those questions that graduate from this pathway are then deployed with opt-out consent at scale across different institutions embedded within the electronic health record.

## Implementation and opportunity
I propose building a trial incubator to optimise the management of respiratory failure. This has relevance for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but more enduringly for much of the work that presents to critical care.
I leverage the existing infrastructure of the NIHR Health Informatics programme for Critical Care (CCHIC) that is led out of UCL/UCLH BRC working alongside the DECOVID collaboration (a high quality database COVID-19 co-led by UCLH and University Hospital Birmingham). CCHIC makes routinely collected clinical data at 7 NHS sites available to researchers. DECOVID has already modelled respiratory support in detail.
We update CCHIC to capture pseudonymised identifiers for the clinical decision maker (prescriber) and build the physician prescribing preference studies: observational correlates of the interventional REMAP-nudge approach.

I then build toward a pilot study of REMAP-Nudge. This grant will support development of this programme at a single site (UCLH). However, the architecture will be built to modern interoperability standards so that it is ready for deployment at NHS sites with an EHR. Alternatively, low-fidelity digital implementation such as that effectively deployed by the RECOVERY trial could be implemented.

Final programme deliverables include:

1. A high-quality respiratory failure database built to scale across multiple NHS sites with long-term follow-up via data linkage
2. A pair of exemplar physician-prescribing preference studies 
3. Qualitative and quantitative evidence from a pilot embedded REMAP-Nudge trial 

### Conclusion
By nudging rather than mandating randomisation and operating within existing clinical norms, we create a trial paradigm that scales efficiently. We generate the sample size to study the varying response to different treatments and deliver a personalised treatment strategy that steadily optimises those millions of small decisions. Ultimately, scaling the trial across multiple sites will deliver a world-first: a true learning health care system that optimises processes and pathways of care not normally amenable to standard parallel arm randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
