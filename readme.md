- [ ] TODO add in note about the frustration of not having the right tools to deploy for rapid learning in surge 1
    go back and give example of nuding for additional / less time on CPAP

We have prepared two worked examples but it should be noted that in the actual project, the interventions to be tested will be developed and selected via a joint clinician/patient/public programme, and not investigator driven. This is especially important given that we will be moving to a presumed consent model, and that we will depend on the clinical workforce to engage with the **nudge** approach. Hence the actual questions to be studied may vary. Further examples might include

- Titration of noradrenaline to target mean arterial blood pressure
- Titration of inspired oxygen to target haemoglobin saturation
- Transfusion of packed red cells to target haemoglobin concentrations
- Supplementation of magnesium and potassium based on plasma concentrations
- Fluid balance targeting after elective surgery
- Duration of routine antibiotic therapy following elective surgery

trial incubator
- sample size
- factorial design and interaction issues: to be explored
    - be explicit in that you think these two things would be suitable for a factorial approach; want to see that scale

the bits of this which are neat and I like and need to do more work on
- continuous PeT approach for non-binary treatments: exploit and explore this
- simulation for designing sample size estimates
- structures for adaptively randomising

## 2020-10-26 change of tack back to peri-op medicine
- make the case that we don't know how long COVID will be with us, nor whether it will be a problem for critical care
- what we do need is an effective learning mechanism

Maybe don't use the REMAP acronym: too close to an existing title; will confuse and distract
