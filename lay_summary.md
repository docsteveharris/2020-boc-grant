# Lay summary

A patient does not choose when to fall ill, nor can he or she anticipate what illness they might experience when choosing a job or buying a house. Yet timing and location both determine the health care that is provided, and the doctors, nurses and other professionals that you meet. In most cases, there is a _random_ component to the _clinician-patient pairing_ leading to variation in practice.
Health care systems work hard to reduce unwarranted variation by developing guidelines, standardising pathways and educating their work force. Yet some variation remains because, for many questions, there is no proof that one strategy is superior to another. Where resources permit, such questions are put to test in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  All RCTs depend on such variation or doubt, or more specifically **equipoise** ("honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians" about the best treatment strategy.[@London2018@410]), to balance the clinician's duty to provide the best current treatment for the patient, and the scientist's duty to identify the best future treatment.
Rather than seeing this variation as a problem, we propose a simple and safe modification of REMAP (**Randomised Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform**)[@angus2015] trials using **nudge theory** to extract learning instead. We will embed in the EHR a clinical decision support (CDS) framework. Where there is existing good evidence, the CDS will alert the clinician at the point of care and reduce variation. However, where there is equipoise, the alert will randomly nudge the clinician. 'Doctor A' will be nudged to behave for that instant like 'Doctor B', and 'Doctor B' like 'Doctor A'. The bedside clinician remains in charge. The nudge is _not_ a mandate. Where the individual clinician also has equipoise and complies with the nudge, we recruit to our embedded RCT. Where the expert clinician refuses because of their specific knowledge, we characterise the patient and learn. Regardless the patient receives the best care, and the scientist learns. 
The small optimisations that we propose to study occur daily or more often: adjusting the oxygen target by a few percent; stopping antibiotics marginally earlier; choosing to supplement a salt (Magnesium) in the blood; or extending a period of non-invasive ventilation by a few more hours. Practical implementation requires a pathway to opt-out consent else the burden would be unmanageable for a trials team. This is best delivered by building a 'trial incubator' that seamlessly moves from observational evidence, to patient and public review of the proposed questions, to pilot implementation with pre-emptive consent, and eventually to hospital or network wide 'nudged' trial. This proposal will attempt to implement this methodology using an established multi-centre data collection platform (Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative), and pilot the approach using bedside alerts to clinicians embedded in the Electronic Health Record at UCLH.  We have designed the work in the field of peri-operative medicine because this allows us to leverage the pre-assessment clinic for pre-emptive consent. However, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues where the uncertainty about optimum care is much greater, the same approach can be brought to bear.
