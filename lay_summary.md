A patient does not choose when to fall ill, nor can he or she anticipate what illness they might experience when choosing a job or buying a house. Yet timing and location both determine the health care that is provided, and the doctors, nurses and other professionals that you meet. In most cases, there is a random component to the clinician-patient pairing leading to variation in practice.
Health care systems work hard to reduce unwarranted variation by building up guidelines, standardising pathways and educating their work force. Yet some variation remains because for many questions there is no proof that one strategy is superior to another. Where resources permit, such questions are put to test in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  All RCTs depend on such variation or doubt, or more specifically **equipoise**, to balance the clinician's duty to provide the best current treatment for the patient, and the scientist's duty to identify the best future treatment. Equipoise is defined as "honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians" about the best treatment strategy.[@London2018@410] 
With a new disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the uncertainty is inevitably much greater and the disagreements more vociferous. Parallel arm RCTs serve well for simple binary comparisons of one drug versus another, but they are too expensive to be a tool for the many small questions we face, and too crude for crucial but subtle questions of timing and dose or intensity. How much oxygen is enough, or when to escalate to from CPAP to invasive ventilation (IMV) are false dichotomised into 'low' versus 'high', or 'early' versus 'late'. Yet these 'finely judged' decisions are exactly those where equipoise exists, and variation is found.
Rather than seeing this variation as a problem, we propose a simple and safe modification of REMAP (**Randomised Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform**)[@angus2015] trials using **nudge theory** to extract learning instead. We will embed in the EHR a clinical decision support (CDS) framework. Where there is existing good evidence, the CDS will alert the clinician at the point of care and reduce variation. However, where there is equipoise, the alert will randomly nudge the clinician. 'Doctor A' will be nudged to behave for that instant like 'Doctor B', and 'Doctor B' like 'Doctor A'. The bedside clinician remains in charge. The nudge is _not_ a mandate. Where the individual clinician also has equipoise and complies with the nudge, we recruit to our embedded RCT. Where the expert clinician refuses because of their specific knowledge, we characterise the patient and learn. Regardless the patient receives the best care, and the scientist learns. 
This proposal will attempt to implement this methodology using an established multi-centre data collection platform (Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative), and pilot the approach using bedside alerts to clinicians embedded in the Electronic Health Record at UCLH. We have selected two key questions: one 'low risk' where we evaluate the optimum oxygen target, and one 'high risk' where we evaluate the optimum duration of CPAP therapy. Both questions are key to the management of SARS-CoV-2 but also relevant for all respiratory disease in critical care. The former is low risk because its implementation is simple, and we have good RCT evidence to show that variation is permissible. The latter is high risk because it is already polarising the critical care community, but is fundamental to our understanding of how to provide respiratory support.

We use this safety net to justify conducting the trial using pre-emptive or opt-out consent model thereby improving recruitment.

For peri-operative care, patients are alerted to the study in the pre-assessment clinic. They can opt-out of any or all of the interventions being evaluated. Those supporting the study can then be efficiently recruited without further cost or interventions, and the trial can scale. As the trial scales, we generate the sample size to study the varying response to different treatments and deliver a personalised treatment strategy that steadily optimises those millions of small decisions.

then we argue randomisation is already happening. Small variations in care are ubiquitous and depend on nothing more than the timing of your illness, the hospital you visit, and the doctor you encounter.

Spring 2020 (BC)

**Hundreds of millions of health care decisions** are made every day. Most decisions are so routine that we don't always notice them: do we give paracetamol for a fever? do we deliver oxygen to a target of 94% or 98%? do we stop the antibiotics this morning or this afternoon? It is inconveivable that the aggregate effect of all these decisions is unimportant. 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are our 'go to' method for studying a single decision. But **traditional RCTs are slow, expensive and cumbersome**. Moreover, they deliver results that are true on _average_ but not adapted for the individual. Personalised medicine recognises that variations in genetics and our current health require adaptations of standard treatments. With enormous sample sizes, RCTs could generate such evidence but the cost would be prohibitive. 
Embedding the trial in the electronic health record (EHR) automates data collection and reduces cost. Complete point of care randomisation would remove the majority of the remaining cost but only if presumed consent is possible. This depends on designing a vehicle to deliver experimental randomisation safely as part of routine care. 
All **randomised** trials depend on the concept of **equipoise** to balance the clinician's duty to provide the best current treatment for the patient, and the scientist's duty to identify the best future treatment. Equipoise can defined as "honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians" about the best treatment strategy.[@London2018@410] But where those strategies are already part of the range of usual care, then we argue randomisation is already happening. Small variations in care are ubiquitous and depend on nothing more than the timing of your illness, the hospital you visit, and the doctor you encounter.
