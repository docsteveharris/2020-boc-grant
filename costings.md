## Justification of requested funding

**Staff** 
**Dr Steve Harris** (applicant/PI; 20%WTE, £102,438.55) will oversee and lead the programme. He will coordinate with UCL and UCLH, guide the development of the ethics extension and CAG approvals, design and support the analysis of the Physician Prescribing Preference studies, and the implementation of the PPI programme and embedded trial. He will be responsible for supervision of the team, and the academic devlopment of the PhD student. He will also lead further grant applications to build toward the multi-site programme grant from Year 4.
The **post-doctoral researcher** (50% WTE, £122,008.52) will have a strong background in health informatics and previous experience of trial implementation. The main focus will be the delivery of REMAP-Nudge. They will support the PI in the delivery of the tasks outlined above, and provide day to day supervision of the PhD student. There is existing funding at IHI for the REVEAL-HF trial (another embedded randomised point of care trial), and it is hoped that the funding streams would synchronise to extract the best value from this individual's time.
The **research student stipend** (£53,256.00) and **PhD fees** (£16,000) will be used to recruit a PhD candidate who will undertake the extension to CCHIC to peri-operative medicine, and the physician prescibing preference studies. They will lead on the qualitative aspects of the evaluation of the ethics of the programme (with support from Prof Moonesinghe). They will actively support the PI and the post-doc in the day to day running of the trial. We have extensive experience of recruiting high quality PhD candidates with or without a clinical background. We currently host 4 such students (all clinical) who are all funded using this model.
We will provide **laptop computers** for the team (£2725 for 3 machines). The software development will be overseen by UCL's Research Software Engineering team who will provide consultancy, advice on MHRA accrediation where the existing clinical decision support module requires modification, and interoperability standards (£6813.74). The infrastructure will be hosted on a virtual machine inside the UCLH Experimental Medicine Application Platform data science environment (£10,179.73). This represents exceptionally good value for NHS server costings.

**Travel and subistence**
The training on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) will be provided for free by Epic systems as per their usual arrangements. These specialist course are not available in the UK or Europe, and the budget (£2,000) will permit the post-doctoral researcher to undertake the 2 weeks training required to work on the clinical decision support/randomisation module. 

**Patient-public involvment**
We will recruit 3 patient/public representatives who will help co-design the REMAP-Nudge interventions and trial. We will provide GCP face-to-face training, and front load their involvement; and use their time to build an effective programme of outreach and engagement with patients attending the pre-assessment clinic. We have used the INVOLVE cost calculator and the recommended budget of £150/day. We would convert the 3rd co-researcher budget (£1500) to support focus group meetings if the initial co-researchers felt this was a better approach.
