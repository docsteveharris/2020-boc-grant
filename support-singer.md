Dear Mike

I am writing in my capacity as Prinicipal Investigator for the Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative (CCHIC). As you know, we have been collating extracts from the critical care units at Cambridge, Guys' and St Thomas', Imperial, Oxford and UCL since 2015. We are about to enroll the Royal Marsden and Bristol into the programme too. The data set currently contains around 45,000 critical care admissions and more than 250 million data points.

Steve (Harris) has approached me to discuss expanding the cohort recruited by CCHIC to include high risk inpatient surgery (similar to that recruited by SNAP-2/EpiCCS). Whilst recognising that we would need to revisit our ethics and current CAG approval under Section 251, I am extremely supportive of the idea. It has two clear advantages. Firstly, the expanded focus on peri-operative medicine would allow us to bring in the expertise of Ramani (Moonesinghe), and her existing experience in data collection for PQIP. Secondly, including those patients at risk of critical illness but not yet critically ill would provide important comparative data. We would, in effect, generate a control group.

Sincerely

Mervyn
